# GPT-Rust: A Rust-Driven GPT Interface

# Overview:
GPT-Rust is a robust, Rust-based driver for the Generative Pre-trained Transformer. This utility allows users to engage in dynamic, context-aware conversations with the GPT model, ensuring a seamless and informative user experience.

# Core Functionalities:

# 1: File Reader:
* Seamlessly read and process file content from the system.
* Prepared content is primed for GPT input, facilitating smooth integration.

# 2: Interactive Query System:
* Users can pose specific queries based on the loaded file.
* Fetches relevant data points or information related to the user's query.

# 3: Dynamic Response Generation:
* GPT crafts and presents user-centric responses based on the queries.
* Allows for an iterative Q&A process, catering to user's evolving informational needs.

# 4: Continuous Conversational Context:
*Emulates the conversational model seen in OpenAI's ChatGPT.
*Ensures the context of previous interactions is retained. This means queries can build upon prior responses, allowing for a more cohesive and informed dialogue.

# Highlight Feature:
The standout feature of GPT-Rust is its ability to maintain a persistent chat-like interface. This ensures that valuable information or context isn't lost in subsequent interactions. Users can continue their line of inquiry based on prior responses, mirroring natural, human-to-human conversations.

# Usage Scenario:
Imagine working on a research project and needing specific data points from a vast document. Instead of sifting through the entire content manually, simply load the document into GPT-Rust and start your interactive Q&A session. Ask follow-up questions, clarify doubts, and deep dive into specifics, all while retaining the context of your previous questions. It's like having a conversation with an expert who has read the entire document meticulously.
